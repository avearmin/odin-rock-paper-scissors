This project is from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors">The Odin Project Foundations Course.</a>

Learners are tasked with creating a simple rock, paper, scissors game using JavaScript. The learner was instructed to design the game
to be played completley from the console. However, this learner's personal goal is to design a user interface for the game once the 
original project's goals have been completed.

Please refer to the link at the top of the readme for the complete instructions of the project.
